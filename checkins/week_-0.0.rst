Hi,

Carl and me had a vital discussion about the syntax that we will propose for a RFC.
There is already a mailing list thread to which I warmly invite you to join:

http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/e4836b5a9d36349e

Read the templatetag syntax proposal there and give your feedback!


I also changed the planed timeline of my project slightly. I will push the
start of writing documentation right after DjangoCon.eu. Hopefully there will
be more comments on that topic that I can integrate then into the project.
Before DjangoCon I will totally focus on backwards compatibility, extending
the test suite, converting the current form rendering to use templates etc.

This Monday is the official start of the GSoC project phase.
So let's get the coding started :-)

Watch my progress on github:
